## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Algorithm

The solver uses a **backtracking algorithm**:

1. **Find Empty Cell**: Locate the next empty cell in the grid
2. **Try Numbers**: Attempt to place numbers 1-9 in the cell
3. **Validate**: Check if the number is valid according to Sudoku rules:
   - No duplicate in the same row
   - No duplicate in the same column
   - No duplicate in the same 3√ó3 box
4. **Recurse**: If valid, move to the next empty cell
5. **Backtrack**: If no valid number works, backtrack and try the next option

### Puzzle Generation

The puzzle generator:

1. **Creates Complete Grid**: Generates a fully solved 9√ó9 Sudoku grid
2. **Removes Numbers**: Strategically removes numbers based on difficulty level
3. **Maintains Uniqueness**: Ensures the resulting puzzle has a unique solution


## üéÆ How to Play

### For Beginners

1. **Understand the Rules**: Each row, column, and 3√ó3 box must contain the numbers 1-9 exactly once
2. **Start Easy**: Use the "Generate Puzzle" feature and select "Easy" difficulty
3. **Use Logic**: Look for cells where only one number can fit
4. **Don't Guess**: Use the solver if you get stuck to see the solution

### For Advanced Users

1. **Challenge Yourself**: Try "Expert" level puzzles
2. **Time Yourself**: See how quickly you can solve different difficulty levels
3. **Learn Patterns**: Study the solved puzzles to improve your solving techniques
